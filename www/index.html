        When you take good care of your eyes, you take good care of yourself. Your eye sight is one of your most important senses as 80% of what you perceive comes through our sense of sight. You need to protect your eyesight to ensure many more years of enjoying vision. By protecting your eyes you will reduce the odds of blindness and vision loss for the rest of your life. You can also reduce the risk of developing eye diseases such as Cataracts and Glaucoma by looking after your eyes.
    </p>
        <p class="para english">
          Vision is an essential part of everyday life, determining how people of all ages learn, communicate, work, play, and interact with the world. There are many things you can do to keep them healthy and make sure you your vision is the best. Follow these simple steps for maintaining healthy eyes well into your sunset years.
        </p>
        <p class="para english">
        You might think your vision is fine or that your eyes are healthy, but visiting your eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated eye examination  is the only way to really be sure. When it comes to common vision problems, some people don’t realize they could see better with glasses or contact lenses. In addition, many common eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration often have no warning signs. A dilated eye examination is the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages.

        <p class="para english">
            
        Perform water procedures for your eyes whenever it is possible, even during your washroom breaks, try to splash water into your eyes. Make sure to wash your eyes with clean water every night and every morning when you wake up. This will prevent infection.

        <p class="para english">
            
       Remove eye makeup every night. This prevents small pieces of make-up from winding up in your eye and possibly scratching your cornea. Keep your eyes clean! Bacteria can easily cause painful and damaging infections in your eyes. Be very careful putting on and removing makeup, inserting contacts, and keep tissues used for sneezing away from your eyes.

        <p class="para english">
            
      To avoid troublesome eye infections like sore eyes and sty, wash your hands several times a day. Don’t rub your fingers on your eyes after shaking hands with someone. That’s a sure way to get sore eyes.

    <div class="w3-cell-row">        
         <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Always eat healthy foods for healthy vision :</h3>
        <p class="para english">
            
      Foods packed with vitamin C and E as well as leafy greens that have plenty of omega-3 fatty acids are great for eye health. Don’t feast on junk food. Your eyes need lots of zinc, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and omega-3 fats. Cantaloupe, carrots, spinach, peanuts, chick peas.
        </p>

        <p class="para english">
            
     If you really want to know how to improve your vision you can to get some sun in the morning. Most people go to extremes trying to avoid sunlight these days, but the human body actually needs a certain amount of light. Sunlight not only provides vitamin D but also helps the eyes to contract and dilate – another form of eye exercise that helps strengthen your eyes.

         <p class="para english">
            
     Around 30 minutes of exercise can reduce your eye pressure by 20 percent. Deep, slow breathing can also reduce eye pressure by increasing the drainage of eye fluid (called the lymphatic system). Thus, both exercise and deep breathing may help patients with glaucoma, a condition where one experiences headache and an increase in eye pressure. Also, stretch your spine and other joints whenever possible.

        <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Sleep eight hours :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
            
     Getting enough sleep will help your eyes recover from a long day’s work. Seven to eight hours of sleep is great. You might have noticed that when you go for long periods of time without adequate sleep, you feel tired and heavy headed. You also may have noticed that your vision seems blurred and that it almost hurts to keep your eyes open. Sleep is important for all your bodily functions, and getting adequate rest can assist in eyesight improvement since sleep allows overworked eye muscles to relax completely.

         <p class="para english">
           Diabetics are at higher risk for eye disease. That is why they need a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year. If you have diabetic retinopathy, you may need an eye examination more often. 
     
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Blink your eyes frequently :</h3>

        <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Keep the surroundings clean :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
           Do keep your home free of dust, especially the bedroom. Use a dust mite cover for your mattress and pillows and frequently wash your sheets in hot water. For floors and counters, use a clean damp cloth and mop instead of dry dusting. For carpeting, use a vacuum with an allergen filter, like a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Drink plenty of water :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
           The next time you notice your vision getting blurry drink a glass of water. It might just be that you're dehydrated and you'll see an almost instant improvement in your vision.
        </p>
        
        
         <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Knowing your family history is important :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
           Many eye diseases cluster in families, so you should know your family’s history of eye disease because you may be at increased risk. Age-related eye diseases, including cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and AMD are expected to dramatically increase.
        </p>
        
          <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Avoid long hours at the electronic devices :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
           This can include computers/laptops, mobile phones and/or TVs. Try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds. This can help reduce eyestrain, especially if you work in front of the computer a lot. Blinking is also beneficial as it lubricates the eyes. Sometimes being too engrossed in your work makes you forget to blink and rest your eyes.
        </p>
        
         <h3 class="text-brown w3-xlarge">Avoid smoking :</h3>
         <p class="para english">
          Smoking is as bad for your eyes as it is for your health. Studies have linked smoking to an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, cataract, and optic nerve damage. These conditions can lead to blindness.

         <p class="para english">

If you have diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) periodic eye check-up is important. Wear the correct contacts lenses and glasses. Keep your prescriptions up to date.

Then gently place your hands over your eyes, with the fingertips resting on the forehead, the palms over the eyes, and the heels of the hands resting on the cheeks. Don’t touch the eyeballs directly, but hollow the hands slightly and allow them to form a curtain of darkness in front of the eyes. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and relax. Envision the eyes absorbing the darkness like a sponge, while also welcoming healing warmth and energy from the hands. Invite the eyes to grow soft and spacious, and enjoy this break from visual stimulation. Continue this palming action as long as it feels soothing—for just a few seconds or up to five minutes.

    Recommended JavaScript library load order for hybrid Cordova apps:

    * "Device-Independent" JavaScript libraries.
    * optional: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug (see notes).
    * Intel XDK device JavaScript library.
    * Cordova/PhoneGap device JavaScript library.
    * "Device-Dependent" JavaScript libraries.
    * Application JavaScript <script> tags and libraries.
    * optional: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug (see notes).

    In complex projects, the JavaScript load order is important. You must
    insure that the underlying device API native code finishes its init, which
    usually takes longer than the webview init...

    VERY IMPORTANT: notice that all of the libraries used in this project are
    located within the app's local directories, which means they will get
    bundled with the app. They are NOT being pulled in over the net. In most
    cases, this is what you should be doing when you build a hybrid mobile
    app. This insures that you always use the JS code that you debugged
    against AND that you are not requiring a data connection (network
    connection) to get the app started. If your app startup required a data
    connection to initialize and start interaction with the user, lack of a
    reliable network connection could be disasterous. Not to mention it
    generally results in a slower load time. Loading locally is much
    friendlier to your end user's data plan and their device battery.  :-)

    NOTE: do not use a directory prefix with the cordova.js file - it is
    inserted automatically by the build system, simulator and other tools and
    is assumed to be in the index.html source directory. You will not find
    this JS file anywhere in your project, it is a "phantom" library. If you
    do see copies of this file as part of your project it should be removed to
    avoid confusion and problems.

    LIBRARY NOTE: If you are using a large number of JavaScript libraries,
    especially third-party libraries (like jQuery, {{ mustache }}, Underscore,
    etc.) that are "independent" of the device APIs provided by the Cordova
    library and plugins - and they are independent of your app code - your
    app initialization will be most successful if you load these libraries
    BEFORE the Cordova JS file, in the <head> section of your index.html file.
    Obviously, any code that depends on Cordova APIs must be loaded AFTER the
    cordova.js library.

    Libraries that are "independent" of the device APIs are libraries that you
    could use in a desktop browser. "Dependent" libraries are, most likely,
    your own code that you've written specifically to work with the Cordova
    device APIs. In some cases, if your device-dependent code requires access
    to device-independent code to get started, you may have to use something
    like CommonJS to force the device-dependent code to wait for the
    device-independent code to initialize, otherwise you may have trouble
    getting your app started.

    Because of this added dependency on the underlying native code (device)
    initialization, you should not use the "document ready" event to start
    your application. You should wait for the cordova "deviceready" event
    before you begin your application (if it uses any Cordova device APIs); in
    practice, it is best to wait for both. (See the init-dev.js file in this
    template for an example of how to wait for both, it generates a custom
    "app.Ready" event that you can wait for and just forget about the other
    events.)

    NOTE: *any* library that redefines addEventListener() or fiddles with
    outstanding events may interfere with capturing the Cordova "deviceready"
    event and should, therefore, be placed *BEFORE* the Cordova JS library in
    the load order.

    ALSO: if you use weinre for debugging, you may have to experiment with the
    placement of the weinre script. Some recommended locations are shown
    within this app. If these locations do not work, you may have to
    experiment. The optimum placement can be app-specific, primarily as a
    function of the included JavaScript libraries and your initialization.
